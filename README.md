# Welcome to Raize

Hello human.

Thank you checking out Razie. Raize is built using Flutter (mobile app) and NodeJS (backend). Fork the repository or submit an issue to get started today.


## Installation

- Official Flutter installation: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
- Setting up NodeJS: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- Setting up Docker (optional): https://docs.docker.com (scroll down to the bottom of the page to see the download options)
- Setting up Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com

## Before you run the api & app

- This version of Raize requires you to have a meetup.com account. Sign up for a meetup.com account before you proceed.
- After you sign up or sign into your meetup.com account, create an OAuth consumer here: https://secure.meetup.com/meetup_api/oauth_consumers/
  - The `website` and `redirect uri` should be a link to an online website, we suggest you to use your **GitHub profile link** or any other website link.
  - Once you have the values for your OAuth consumer, replace the values in the `api/config/env/env.json` file.
  - We used Instamojo as our ticket payments integration, you may not use or worry about this right now. We're working hard to bring better and improved abilities to this platform.
